WebDashboard Bridge
==

This library provides a low-level interface to the WebDashboard server. It can update a distributed hash table (much like NetworkTables) and send and receive events.

To use, grab the latest JAR from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Stormgears-FRC-5422/WebDashboardBridge/releases).

Add the JAR to your build path/classpath. In your code, make sure call the `WebDashboard.init()` method before doing anything. 

See the [wiki](https://github.com/Stormgears-FRC-5422/WebDashboardClient/wiki) for more documentation.
